# Prompt Trail — Chitragupt Session Log

**Project:** Chitragupt — Agentic Business Requirement Analyzer
**Purpose:** Chronological record of all user prompts for this project.
**Note:** Entries marked `[INFERRED]` are reconstructed from git commit history where the originating prompt was not captured verbatim.

---

## Discovery Phase

**P-001** `[INFERRED]`
> Set up the initial project repository with a product discovery workbook and core discovery phase documents — epistemology, ontology, invariants, and stakeholder unknowns.

**P-002**
> these are some of our system definition documents for creating a Agentic business requirement analyzer - elaborate and make this documents to cover all aspects of the scope without missing any important feature. All areas of the system at this point are important like RAG, AI model selection, budget, speed, ease of use etc

**P-003**
> create answers in the unknowns_and_stakeholder...doc in /doc as if you were the client - ensure the answers are deeply thought and understood by the BA and system architect teams

**P-004** `[INFERRED]`
> fix the markdown lint issues across the discovery documents and push

**P-005**
> add another seciton to the unknowns file called key dependencies and assumptions with pre filled answers and then push again

**P-006** `[INFERRED]`
> resolve the remaining markdown lint issues in the unknowns document and push

---

## Sprint Planning & Conventions

**P-007**
> organize the docs in respective dirs and now create the sprint docs in its own dir. remove the files that are not needed now - create the sprint docs based on the existing docs and the unknowns...doc. Create a doc for project conventions and protocols to be followed

---

## Sprint 0 — Foundation & Technology Selection

**P-008**
> we are going to define sprint 0 - this should have tech stack, tools & dependencies registery, architeccture and model choices for RAG pipeline and create a project scaffolding. this is a multi dimensional sprint. Our choices depend on budget, security, ease of use etc now define the sprint 0 document

**P-009**
> push this to remote with a commit message

**P-010**
> the sprint 0 makes some assumptions on what model we will use, tech etc. this should not be the case - later we will be translating this into epics and dev stories. Make this doc a abstract

**P-011**
> this should also include all interfaces and external sources that we would likely use enumerated

**P-012**
> we will start with sprint 0. Create a dir called /sprint0 with all necessaryy decision documents

**P-013**
> I have added a file called prompt trail in /docs create a log file of the prompts we have used so far and delete the text file and then push

**P-014**
> the prompt_trail.md has prompts logged from some other project too remove them only keep the current project prompts and if sometthing is missing inject the necessary prompts - you are free to assume the context based on what we have

**P-015**
> for the orchestration framework make a configuration file which can select different types of orchestration connectors (for eg - langchain, transormers, together ai, crew ai any adk/sdk etc and the decisioning is at compile time or runtime. the decision should be based on the constraints on security, budget, client choices etc - this should be a fully configurable middleware later on. ensure this project gets logged to the prompt trail

**P-016**
> in the docs we also want to add to the relevant docs - the ability of the output to create a templated BRD or High Level Architecture Diagram which is signed off by the client eventually include this as well

**P-017**
> we want to redefine the docs in sprint0 - we dont want a doc sprawl reduce the docs to manageable numbers. Also we want to introduce a HITL state aware context for BAs to begin from problem defination and intent ingestion, where the BA is led through all phases of the project planning via active chat communications and uploads docs only at relevant checkpoints including other inputs. Lets remove the orchestration middleware for now and redo the docs again. log the prompt in the prompt registery and do it for all subsequent prompts in this project

**P-018**
> make the readme prod grade with mermaid style diagrams and also introduce a strict epimestology and database architecture in the appropriate dirs log everything

**P-019**
> Now since we have enhanced the project our next sprint sprint1 should have a robust state machine design to allow user intent journey with acceptance criterria for state transitioning and a LLM RAG pipeline at each state to ensure the user journey is intutive. Our priority is the Solution having the capability to guide a user on next steps. Log the prompt. Give a dir called sprint1 with a .md file with what we should prioritize in sprint1 - this is our core engine

**P-020**
> the state transition in sprint1 has to have a acceptance criteria (eg. upload diagrams or architecture plans etc or client intent etc) ensure it is part of the sprint before we move on

**P-021**
> one last document the technical stack - my take build the state or dot machine in rust, the AI orchestrator or RAG in python and tthe APIs iin golang if this is fundamentally correct one more techstac doc in /architecture please and then we start coding. log the prompt

**P-022**
> push the docs to remote again

**P-023**
> create another dir called diagrams in /docs which has detailed diagrams - we need solid diagrams for state machine at a concept level hard gates why we need it and so on. all diagrams should be simple to understand and mermaid style create some important understanding docs for now 4-5 should be enough

**P-024**
> let us begin with a simple project scaffolding - I have a local rust toolchain on my local machine - we build the rust kernel only for now nothing else with required files and stubs only, tools, cargo dependencies etc and ensure minimal build works - if this is not part of sprint1 make it. log the prompt and start

**P-025**
> now it is important to move sprint0 and 1 into the /docs folder and reflect our new choices - lets not overdo sprint0 which can have basic discovery and documentation tasks. Also now we need another folder called /tech-docs with detailed explaination of how our state machine works. Clean up the repo and especially docs to reflect all this - also introduce a contributing.md and a license.md, make the readme professional

**P-026**
> wonderful now move the tech-docs in /docs also and then push to remote

**P-027**
> a small bio for the github remote please

**P-028**
> now create a /tests dir and write unit tests for the services/state-machine and ensure all the tests assert true or pass cover both positive and negative senarios include edge or boundary cases. Use appropriate test sub dirs for testing

**P-029**
> create a .github dir with a ci.yaml file for github actions only - passing criteria for now  is the unit or e2e tests if any then push to remote

**P-031**
> [fmt diff from CI — cargo fmt --check failures across error.rs, manager.rs, main.rs, and test files]. fix this issue

**P-030**
> Run cargo fmt --check
>   cargo fmt --check
>   shell: /usr/bin/bash -e {0}
>   env:
>     CARGO_HOME: /home/runner/.cargo
>     CARGO_INCREMENTAL: 0
>     CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always
>     CACHE_ON_FAILURE: false
> error: target tuple in channel name 'stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu'
> Error: Process completed with exit code 1. fix this ci error in ci

**P-034**
> the docs in sprint 1 did not contextualize the docs in sprint 0 modify sprint 0 or 1 as needed to optimize the project - use BA specific language and narrative for the docs. This is not technical documenttation - that we will create much later

**P-033**
> for the 2nd part of the sprint1 - we want LLMs for the following functions: 1. Intent classification 2. RAG based search 3. Visual diagrams understanding 4. Document exploration / chunking / embeddings 5. Output or SRS creation 6. For data transformations 8. Requirement refinement 9. voice / image to text 10. localization Also we want the LLM and the state to be injected at runtime only into the session or user object which we will define later - we will use lazy loading to avoid unecessary delays - and follow a factory or session factory architecture - keeping this in mind now create a design pattern strategy document in /sprints/sprint1 and the llm universe document. Also, keep in mind the constraints of complixity and budget

**P-032**
> error: use of `default` to create a unit struct … GateManager::default() … got this error again there is a dependency issue - lets make this docker first so that the githhub actions work without a issue - create the necessary docker files and then make changes to the ci accordingly ensure all test pass in docker and then push

**P-035**
> check all files and understand all things

**P-036**
> push all chnages to https://github.com/nitingawali27/chitragupt-business-analyzer also github action

**P-037**
> push to here
